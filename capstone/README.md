This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation

This project requires NodeJs. And then from the command line, enter `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Rules of the game`

Younger players are often able to compete with older players because they can be very good at memory-based games.

* The objective is to collect the most pairs of cards.
* Shuffle the cards and lay them on the table, face down, in rows.
* The youngest player goes first. Play then continues in a clockwise direction.
* On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and keeps them if the cards match (for instance, two kings)
* If they successfully match a pair they get to keep the cards, and that player gets another turn.
* When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position) and it becomes the next player’s turn.
* The trick is to remember which cards are where.
* The person with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.
