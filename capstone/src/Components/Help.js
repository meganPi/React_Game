                <li>The youngest player goes first. Play then continues in a clockwise direction.</li>
                <li>On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and keeps them if the cards match (for instance, two kings)</li>
                <li>If they successfully match a pair they get to keep the cards, and that player gets another turn.</li>
                <li>When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position) and it becomes the next playerâ€™s turn.</li>
                <li>The trick is to remember which cards are where.</li>
                <li>The person with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.</li>
